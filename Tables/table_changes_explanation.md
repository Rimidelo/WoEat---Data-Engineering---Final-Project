# Table Structure Changes - Detailed Explanation

## Overview
Based on the feedback provided, I've restructured the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to better align with data engineering best practices. Here are the detailed changes and reasoning:

## Bronze Layer Changes

### 1. Removed Aggregated Data from Bronze
**Problem**: The original `BRONZE_RESTAURANT_PERFORMANCE` table contained calculated averages, which is inappropriate for the bronze layer.
**Solution**: 
- Removed `BRONZE_RESTAURANT_PERFORMANCE` table entirely
- Added raw data tables: `BRONZE_RESTAURANTS`, `BRONZE_RATINGS`, and `BRONZE_ORDER_ITEMS`

### 2. Fixed Driver Rating Issues
**Problem**: Storing only the latest rating without history in `BRONZE_DRIVERS.rating` field.
**Solution**:
- Removed `rating` field from `BRONZE_DRIVERS`
- Created separate `BRONZE_RATINGS` table to store all rating history
- This table includes ratings for drivers, food, and delivery separately
- Maintains full audit trail of all ratings over time

### 3. Improved Order Structure
**Problem**: Orders had a generic `list items` field without proper normalization.
**Solution**:
- Created `BRONZE_ORDER_ITEMS` table to properly normalize order items
- Added fields for quantity, item price, and order time
- This enables proper tracking of individual items within orders

### 4. Added Restaurant Master Data
**Solution**: Added `BRONZE_RESTAURANTS` table to store restaurant master data including:
- Restaurant name, cuisine type, zone
- Active flag to track restaurant status
- Creation timestamp for auditing

## Silver Layer Changes

### 1. Added Calculated Fields
**Enhancement**: Added calculated fields that are derived from bronze data:
- `prep_time_minutes`: Calculated from bronze prep start/end times
- `delivery_time_minutes`: Calculated from order and delivery times
- `extended_price`: Calculated as quantity × item_price in order items

### 2. Moved Aggregations to Silver
**Solution**: Added performance tables that were inappropriate in bronze:
- `SILVER_RESTAURANT_PERFORMANCE`: Daily aggregated restaurant metrics
- `SILVER_DRIVER_PERFORMANCE`: Daily aggregated driver metrics

### 3. Improved Data Quality
**Enhancement**: Added data quality fields:
- `cancelled` boolean flag for easier filtering
- Proper normalization of order items
- Consistent timestamp fields across all tables

## Gold Layer Changes

### 1. Fixed Menu Items Dimension
**Problem**: Menu items had `restaurant_id` field suggesting multiple restaurants could share items.
**Solution**: 
- Removed `restaurant_id` and `restaurant_key` from `DIM_MENU_ITEMS`
- This allows for menu items to be shared across restaurants if needed
- Restaurant association is maintained through the order items fact table

### 2. Removed Average Prep Time from Restaurant Dimension
**Problem**: Average prep time in restaurant dimension would update too frequently.
**Solution**:
- Removed `avg_prep_time` from `DIM_RESTAURANTS`
- Created `FACT_RESTAURANT_DAILY` to track daily performance metrics
- This provides better historical tracking and reduces dimension updates

### 3. Added Missing Date Dimension
**Problem**: Missing date dimension for proper time-based analysis.
**Solution**: Added `DIM_DATE` with standard date attributes:
- Year, quarter, month, week, day of week
- Month and day names for reporting
- Weekend and holiday flags for business analysis

### 4. Enhanced Fact Tables
**Improvements**:
- Added `FACT_RATINGS` to track all rating events with proper keys
- Added missing `datetime order_time` to `FACT_ORDER_ITEMS`
- Added `item_price` to track pricing at time of order
- Enhanced `FACT_ORDERS` with prep time and tip tracking

### 5. Added Business Summary Table
**Enhancement**: Created `FACT_BUSINESS_SUMMARY` for comprehensive business monitoring:
- Daily/hourly business metrics
- Overall performance indicators
- Active driver and restaurant counts
- Total revenue and satisfaction metrics

### 6. Fixed Driver Dimension
**Problem**: Driver dimension included rating which should be historical.
**Solution**:
- Removed `rating` from `DIM_DRIVERS`
- Ratings are now tracked in `FACT_RATINGS` and aggregated in daily facts
- Added proper SCD Type 2 tracking with record dates

## Key Benefits of Changes

1. **Proper Layering**: Raw data in bronze, cleaned/calculated in silver, modeled for analytics in gold
2. **Historical Tracking**: Complete audit trail for ratings and performance metrics
3. **Scalability**: Separated frequently changing data (ratings, performance) from stable dimensions
4. **Flexibility**: Menu items can be shared across restaurants, comprehensive date analysis
5. **Business Intelligence**: Added business summary table for executive dashboards
6. **Data Quality**: Better normalization and data validation through proper structure

## Data Flow Summary

1. **Bronze → Silver**: Clean and calculate derived fields, create daily aggregations
2. **Silver → Gold**: Transform to dimensional model, create business metrics
3. **Gold Analytics**: Support for trend analysis, performance monitoring, and business intelligence

These changes ensure the data architecture follows medallion architecture principles while supporting comprehensive business analytics and maintaining data quality throughout the pipeline.
