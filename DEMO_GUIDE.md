---

## üöÄ **Live Demonstration Steps**

### **Step 1: Environment Setup** (1 minute)
```bash
# Show running services
docker ps

# Verify all containers are healthy
echo "‚úÖ Spark Cluster: Ready"
echo "‚úÖ Kafka Streaming: Ready" 
echo "‚úÖ MinIO Storage: Ready"
echo "‚úÖ Airflow Orchestration: Ready"
```

### **Step 2: Bronze Layer - Data Ingestion** (3 minutes)
```bash
# Run Bronze layer ingestion
docker exec spark-iceberg spark-submit /tmp/bronze_simple.py
```

**üéôÔ∏è Narration:**
> "This ingests raw data from multiple sources - orders, drivers, restaurants, weather data. Notice how we handle different data formats and sources, creating a unified Bronze layer in Iceberg format with full schema evolution support."

**üìä Expected Output:**
- 13 menu items
- 20 drivers  
- 10 restaurant performance records
- 8 weather records
- 3 sample orders

### **Step 3: Silver Layer - Data Quality & Cleaning** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Process Silver layer with data quality checks
docker exec spark-iceberg spark-submit /tmp/silver_processing.py
```

**üéôÔ∏è Narration:**
> "The Silver layer applies data quality rules, validates business constraints, and performs data cleansing. Notice the comprehensive quality reports showing 100% pass rates for our validation rules."

### **Step 4: Gold Layer - Business Analytics with SCD Type 2** (3 minutes)
```bash
# Create Gold layer with dimensional modeling
docker exec spark-iceberg spark-submit /tmp/gold_processing.py
```

**üéôÔ∏è Narration:**
> "The Gold layer implements a star schema with fact tables and slowly changing dimensions. Watch how SCD Type 2 tracks historical changes in driver information with effective dates and current flags."

**üìà Key Metrics to Highlight:**
- Total orders and revenue
- Average delivery times
- SLA performance metrics
- Restaurant performance by revenue

### **Step 5: üéØ MAIN FEATURE - Late-Arriving Data Demo** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Demonstrate late-arriving restaurant reports
docker exec spark-iceberg spark-submit /tmp/late_arriving_data.py
```

**üéôÔ∏è Narration:**
> "Now for the key feature - handling late-arriving data. In real food delivery platforms, restaurant performance reports often arrive at the end of the day, sometimes 24-48 hours late. Let me show you how our system handles this."

**üìä What to Point Out:**

1. **Before State**: Original restaurant data with on-time arrivals
2. **Late Data Arrival**: Restaurant reports for June 4th-5th arriving on June 7th
3. **Impact Analysis**: 
   - 5 restaurants with 3-day-late data (CRITICAL alerts)
   - 5 restaurants with 2-day-late data (WARNING alerts)
4. **Automatic Handling**: System detects and flags late arrivals
5. **Reprocessing**: Triggers updates to Silver/Gold layers for affected dates

## üé§ **Key Points to Emphasize**

### **1. Real-World Problem Solving**
> "This isn't just academic - food delivery platforms really face this challenge. Restaurant reports come in late, affecting daily analytics and business decisions."

### **2. Technical Excellence**
- **Scalability**: Distributed processing with Spark
- **Reliability**: ACID transactions with Iceberg
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive data quality and late arrival tracking
- **Flexibility**: Schema evolution without breaking existing data

### **3. Data Engineering Best Practices**
- **Medallion Architecture**: Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold
- **Data Lineage**: Full tracking from source to analytics
- **Quality Gates**: Validation at every layer
- **Historical Tracking**: SCD Type 2 implementation

### **4. Production Readiness**
- **Containerized**: Complete Docker deployment
- **Orchestrated**: Airflow DAGs for automation
- **Monitored**: Real-time alerts and quality metrics
- **Tested**: End-to-end pipeline validation

## üó£Ô∏è **Sample Presentation Script**

### Opening (30 seconds):
> "Good morning! Today I'm presenting WoEat - a complete data engineering solution for a food delivery platform. This project demonstrates modern data lakehouse architecture with real-world late-arriving data scenarios."

### Technical Demo (8 minutes):
> "Let me walk you through the live system..." 
> [Follow Steps 1-5 above]

### Problem Solution Focus (2 minutes):
> "The key challenge we solved is late-arriving restaurant data. In production, this causes analytics delays and business impact. Our solution automatically detects, categorizes, and reprocesses late data while maintaining full audit trails."

## üö® **Troubleshooting Tips**

### If Containers Aren't Running:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.spark.yml up -d
```

### If Scripts Fail:
```bash
# Copy fresh scripts to container
docker cp processing/bronze_simple.py spark-iceberg:/tmp/
docker cp processing/silver_processing.py spark-iceberg:/tmp/
docker cp processing/gold_processing.py spark-iceberg:/tmp/
docker cp processing/late_arriving_data.py spark-iceberg:/tmp/
```

### Quick Verification:
```bash
# Check if tables exist
docker exec spark-iceberg spark-sql -e "SHOW TABLES IN demo.bronze"
docker exec spark-iceberg spark-sql -e "SHOW TABLES IN demo.silver"
docker exec spark-iceberg spark-sql -e "SHOW TABLES IN demo.gold"
```

## üéØ **Questions Your Teacher Might Ask**

### **Q: "How does this handle real-time data?"**
**A:** "We use Kafka for real-time streaming, with Spark Structured Streaming for processing. The late-arriving data demo shows how we handle event-time vs processing-time scenarios."

### **Q: "What about data quality?"**
**A:** "Every layer has comprehensive quality checks. Silver layer validates nulls, data types, and business rules with detailed reporting."

### **Q: "How does this scale?"**
**A:** "Built on distributed systems - Spark for processing, Iceberg for storage with cloud-native scaling. Each component can scale independently."

### **Q: "What makes this production-ready?"**
**A:** "Complete monitoring, automated orchestration with Airflow, containerized deployment, and robust error handling with alerting."
